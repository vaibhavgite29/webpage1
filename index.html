            <h2>Republic Day(26 January)</h2>
            <p>India celebrates its Republic Day on January 26 each year. The 74th Republic Day will be observed this
                year on Thursday by the people of the nation, which will a be a lot similar but a lot different too.
                This will be the first Republic Day for President Draupadi Murmu who will unfurl the tricolour on the
                recently inaugurated Kartavaya Path, to kick off the festivities.On January 26, 1950, the Indian
                Constitution was formally adopted, and that event is commemorated on Republic Day. India was freed from
                the British Raj in 1947, but it wasn't until January 26, 1950, that the Indian Constitution took effect,
                making India a sovereign state and establishing it as a republic.This parade is presided over by the
                President of India. Chief Guest this year is the president of Egypt Mr. Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. One of the
                main functions of the Republic Day Parade is to pay tribute to the martyrs who have sacrificed their
                lives for the country and to confer bravery awards on military persons, citizenry and children for
                showing courage in the face of adversity.

            <h2>Independence Day(15 August)</h2>
            <p>
                Independence Day is marked throughout India with flag-raising ceremonies, drills, and the singing of the
                Indian national anthem. Additionally, various cultural programs are made available in the state
                capitals. After the prime minister participates in the flag-raising ceremony at the Red Fort historic
                monument in Old Delhi, a parade ensues with members of the armed forces and police. The prime minister
                then delivers a televised address to the country, recounting the major accomplishments of India during
                the previous year and outlining future challenges and goals. Kite flying has also become an Independence
                Day tradition, with kites of various sizes, shapes, and colours filling the sky. Also, to commemorate
                the day, government offices in New Delhi remain lit throughout the holiday, even though they are
                closed.The most recognizable symbol of Remembrance Sunday is the red poppy, which became associated with
                World War I memorials after scores of the flowers bloomed in the former battlefields of Belgium and
                northern France. (The phenomenon was depicted in the popular 1915 poem “In Flanders Fields,” by Canadian
                soldier John McCrae.) In 1921 the newly formed British Legion (now the Royal British Legion), a
                charitable organization for veterans, began selling red paper poppies for Armistice Day, and its annual
                Poppy Appeal has been enormously successful since. In addition to poppies intended to be worn on
                clothing, wreaths made of poppies are frequently displayed at memorial sites. Beginning in the 1930s,
                some groups have alternatively promoted white poppies as an emblem of peace, though this has often met
                with controversy.

            <h2>Gandhi Jayanti(2nd October)</h2>
            <p>
                Educational institutions are also closed on this day to honor Gandhiji who is considered as the ''Father
                of the Nation'' because of his leadership during the freedom struggle that led to India's independence
                from the British in 1947. On this day, tributes are paid to Gandhiji all over the country in schools,
                colleges, government offices, as well as in social, political, and private organizations.Mahatma Gandhi,
                also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, and died on January 30, 1948. He
                was a political and spiritual leader in India and played a key role in the Indian independence movement.
                Gandhi developed the novel technique of non-violent agitation, which he called "Satyagraha", loosely
                translated as "moral domination".
